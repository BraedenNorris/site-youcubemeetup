            <p class="focused">With the recent post-poning of Mineorama a group of community members, YouTubers, and server hosts have came together with the intention of making the most of the situation.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>YouCube Meetup is the result of a drive to rectify a wrongdoing in the community. On July 12th, we'll be hosting a fan meetup with many who originally intended to attend Mineorama. No charge. No catch. Open to everyone. We're currently looking for a venue to facilitate the event and we'll be making announcements via our Twitter, as more information becomes available.</p>
