Building the Site
--

Node.js and NPM must be installed first.

 1. If you do not have Bower and Grunt installed globally yet, run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.
 2. For your first build, with the current working directory set to this project directory, run `npm install && bower install` to install necessary dependencies.
 3. Run `grunt`, again with the current working directory set to this project directory. This will compile all assets without any minification. You can alternately run `grunt dist` to run the site, minifying HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, etc. This may take several minutes to run.

Pull Requests
--

All pull requests are welcomed and will be examined for modification to the website.
